# <a name="view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files"></a>SQL Server セットアップ ログ ファイルの表示と読み取り

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

SQL Server のセットアップでは、既定で、 **\%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log** 内の日付と時刻を名前に含むフォルダーに、ログ ファイルが作成されます。*nnn* は、インストールされている SQL Server のバージョンに対応する番号です。 タイムスタンプ付きのログ フォルダーの名前形式は YYYYMMDD_hhmmss です。 セットアップを自動モードで実行した場合は、%temp%\sqlsetup*.log 内にログが作成されます。 ログ フォルダー内のログ ファイルはすべて、それぞれのログ フォルダー内で Log\*.cab ファイルにアーカイブされます。  

   | ファイル           | [パス] |
   | :------        | :----------------------------- |
   | **Summary.txt**    | \%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log |

 >[!NOTE]
 > The numbers in the path *nnn* correspond to the version of SQL being installed. In the above picture, SQL 2017 was installed, so the folder is 140. For SQL 2016, the folder would be 130, and for SQL 2014 the folder would be 120.
  
 SQL server setup completes three basic phases: 
  
1.  Global Rules verification: validates basic system requirements
2.  Component update: checks to see if there are any updates available for the media being installed
3.  User-requested action: allows the user to select and customize features
  

This workflow produces a single summary log, and either a single detail log for a base SQL Server installation, or two detail logs for when update, such as a service pack, is installed along with the base installation. 
  
Additionally, there are datastore files that contain a snapshot of the state of all the configuration objects that are being tracked by the setup process, and are useful for troubleshooting configuration errors. XML dump files are created for each execution phase and are saved in the Datastore log subfolder under the time-stamped log folder. 

The following sections describe [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup log files.  
  
## Summary.txt file 
  
### Overview  
 This file shows the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that were detected during Setup, the operating system environment, command-line parameter values if they are specified, and the overall status of each MSI/MSP that was executed.
  
 The log is organized into the following sections:
  
-   An overall summary of the execution  
-   Properties and the configuration of the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup was run  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product features previously installed on the computer  
-   Description of the installation version and installation package properties
-   Runtime input settings that are provided during install  
-   Location of the configuration file  
-   Details of the execution results  
-   Global rules  
-   Rules specific to the installation scenario  
-   Failed rules  
-   Location of the rules report file


  >[!NOTE]
  > Note that when patching there can be a number of sub folders (one for each instance being patched, and one for shared features) which contain a similiar set of files (i.e. %programfiles%\MicrosoftSQL Server\130\Setup Bootstrap\Log\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\MSSQLSERVER). 
  
### Location  
 The summary.txt is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\.
  
 To find errors in the summary text file, search the file by using the "error" or "failed" keywords.
  
## Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file
  
### Overview  
 The summary_engine base file is similar to the summary file and is generated during the main workflow.
  
### Location  
 The Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.
  
  
## Detail.txt file
  
### Overview
 Detail.txt is generated for the main workflow such as install or upgrade, and provides the details of the execution. The logs in the file are generated based on the time when each action for the installation was invoked. The text file shows the order in which the actions were executed, as well as their dependencies.  
  
### Location  
 The detail.txt file is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\Detail.txt.  
  
 If an error occurs during the Setup process, the exception or error is logged at the end of this file. To find the errors in this file, first examine the end of the file followed by a search of the file for the "error" or "exception" keywords
    
## MSI log files
  
### Overview  
 The MSI log files provide details of the installation package process. They are generated by the MSIEXEC during the installation of the specified package.  
  
 Types of MSI log files:
  
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Language>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>\_\<workflow>.log  
  
### Location  
 The MSI log files are located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\<Name\>.log.  
  
 At the end of the file is a summary of the execution, which includes the success or failure status and properties. To find the error in the MSI file, search for "value 3" and review the text before and after.  
  
## ConfigurationFile.ini file
  
### Overview  
 The configuration file contains the input settings that are provided during installation. It can be used to restart the installation without having to enter the settings manually. However, passwords for the accounts, PID, and some parameters are not saved in the configuration file. The settings can be either added to the file or provided by using the command line or the Setup user interface. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2016 Using a Configuration File](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-2016-using-a-configuration-file.md).  
  
### Location  
 The ConfigurationFile.ini is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.  
  
## SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm file
  
### Overview  
 The system configuration check report contains a short description for each executed rule, and the execution status.
  
### Location  
The SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.

# View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

SQL Server Setup creates log files in a dated and time-stamped folder within **\%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log** by default, where *nnn* are numbers that correspond to the version of SQL that's being installed. The time-stamped log folder name format is YYYYMMDD_hhmmss. When Setup is executed in unattended mode, the logs are created within %temp%\sqlsetup*.log. All files in the log folder are archived into the Log\*.cab file in their respective log folder.

# View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

SQL Server Setup creates log files in a dated and time-stamped folder within **\%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log** by default, where *nnn* are numbers that correspond to the version of SQL that's being installed. The time-stamped log folder name format is YYYYMMDD_hhmmss. When Setup is executed in unattended mode, the logs are created within %temp%\sqlsetup*.log. All files in the log folder are archived into the Log\*.cab file in their respective log folder.  

   | File           | Path |
   | :------        | :----------------------------- |
   | **Summary.txt**    | \%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log |
   | **Summary_\<MachineName>\_Date.txt**  | \%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\YYYYMMDD_hhmmss |

 >[!NOTE]
 > The numbers in the path *nnn* correspond to the version of SQL being installed. In the above picture, SQL 2017 was installed, so the folder is 140. For SQL 2016, the folder would be 130, and for SQL 2014 the folder would be 120.
  
 SQL server setup completes three basic phases: 
  
1.  Global Rules verification: validates basic system requirements
2.  Component update: checks to see if there are any updates available for the media being installed
3.  User-requested action: allows the user to select and customize features
  

This workflow produces a single summary log, and either a single detail log for a base SQL Server installation, or two detail logs for when update, such as a service pack, is installed along with the base installation. 
  
Additionally, there are datastore files that contain a snapshot of the state of all the configuration objects that are being tracked by the setup process, and are useful for troubleshooting configuration errors. XML dump files are created for each execution phase and are saved in the Datastore log subfolder under the time-stamped log folder. 

The following sections describe [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup log files.  
  
## Summary.txt file 
  
### Overview  
 This file shows the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that were detected during Setup, the operating system environment, command-line parameter values if they are specified, and the overall status of each MSI/MSP that was executed.
  
 The log is organized into the following sections:
  
-   An overall summary of the execution  
-   Properties and the configuration of the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup was run  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product features previously installed on the computer  
-   Description of the installation version and installation package properties
-   Runtime input settings that are provided during install  
-   Location of the configuration file  
-   Details of the execution results  
-   Global rules  
-   Rules specific to the installation scenario  
-   Failed rules  
-   Location of the rules report file


  >[!NOTE]
  > Note that when patching there can be a number of sub folders (one for each instance being patched, and one for shared features) which contain a similiar set of files (i.e. %programfiles%\MicrosoftSQL Server\130\Setup Bootstrap\Log\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\MSSQLSERVER). 
  
### Location  
 The summary.txt is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\.
  
 To find errors in the summary text file, search the file by using the "error" or "failed" keywords.
  
## Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file
  
### Overview  
 The summary_engine base file is similar to the summary file and is generated during the main workflow.
  
### Location  
 The Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.
  
  
## Detail.txt file
  
### Overview
 Detail.txt is generated for the main workflow such as install or upgrade, and provides the details of the execution. The logs in the file are generated based on the time when each action for the installation was invoked. The text file shows the order in which the actions were executed, as well as their dependencies.  
  
### Location  
 The detail.txt file is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\Detail.txt.  
  
 If an error occurs during the Setup process, the exception or error is logged at the end of this file. To find the errors in this file, first examine the end of the file followed by a search of the file for the "error" or "exception" keywords
    
## MSI log files
  
### Overview  
 The MSI log files provide details of the installation package process. They are generated by the MSIEXEC during the installation of the specified package.  
  
 Types of MSI log files:
  
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Language>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>\_\<workflow>.log  
  
### Location  
 The MSI log files are located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\<Name\>.log.  
  
 At the end of the file is a summary of the execution, which includes the success or failure status and properties. To find the error in the MSI file, search for "value 3" and review the text before and after.  
  
## ConfigurationFile.ini file
  
### Overview  
 The configuration file contains the input settings that are provided during installation. It can be used to restart the installation without having to enter the settings manually. However, passwords for the accounts, PID, and some parameters are not saved in the configuration file. The settings can be either added to the file or provided by using the command line or the Setup user interface. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2016 Using a Configuration File](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-2016-using-a-configuration-file.md).  
  
### Location  
 The ConfigurationFile.ini is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.  
  
## SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm file
  
### Overview  
 The system configuration check report contains a short description for each executed rule, and the execution status.
  
### Location  
The SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.

 >[!NOTE]
 > The numbers in the path *nnn* correspond to the version of SQL being installed. In the above picture, SQL 2017 was installed, so the folder is 140. For SQL 2016, the folder would be 130, and for SQL 2014 the folder would be 120.
  
 SQL server setup completes three basic phases: 
  
1.  Global Rules verification: validates basic system requirements
2.  Component update: checks to see if there are any updates available for the media being installed
3.  User-requested action: allows the user to select and customize features
  

This workflow produces a single summary log, and either a single detail log for a base SQL Server installation, or two detail logs for when update, such as a service pack, is installed along with the base installation. 
  
Additionally, there are datastore files that contain a snapshot of the state of all the configuration objects that are being tracked by the setup process, and are useful for troubleshooting configuration errors. XML dump files are created for each execution phase and are saved in the Datastore log subfolder under the time-stamped log folder. 

The following sections describe [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup log files.  
  
## Summary.txt file 
  
### Overview  
 This file shows the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that were detected during Setup, the operating system environment, command-line parameter values if they are specified, and the overall status of each MSI/MSP that was executed.
  
 The log is organized into the following sections:
  
-   An overall summary of the execution  
-   Properties and the configuration of the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup was run  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product features previously installed on the computer  
-   Description of the installation version and installation package properties
-   Runtime input settings that are provided during install  
-   Location of the configuration file  
-   Details of the execution results  
-   Global rules  
-   Rules specific to the installation scenario  
-   Failed rules  
-   Location of the rules report file


  >[!NOTE]
  > Note that when patching there can be a number of sub folders (one for each instance being patched, and one for shared features) which contain a similiar set of files (i.e. %programfiles%\MicrosoftSQL Server\130\Setup Bootstrap\Log\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\MSSQLSERVER). 
  
### Location  
 The summary.txt is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\.
  
 To find errors in the summary text file, search the file by using the "error" or "failed" keywords.
  
## Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file
  
### Overview  
 The summary_engine base file is similar to the summary file and is generated during the main workflow.
  
### Location  
 The Summary_\<MachineName>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMss.txt file is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.
  
  
## Detail.txt file
  
### Overview
 Detail.txt is generated for the main workflow such as install or upgrade, and provides the details of the execution. The logs in the file are generated based on the time when each action for the installation was invoked. The text file shows the order in which the actions were executed, as well as their dependencies.  
  
### Location  
 The detail.txt file is located within %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\Detail.txt.  
  
 If an error occurs during the Setup process, the exception or error is logged at the end of this file. To find the errors in this file, first examine the end of the file followed by a search of the file for the "error" or "exception" keywords
    
## MSI log files
  
### Overview  
 The MSI log files provide details of the installation package process. They are generated by the MSIEXEC during the installation of the specified package.  
  
 Types of MSI log files:
  
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Language>\_\<Interaction>.log   
-   \<Feature>_\<Architecture>\_\<Interaction>\_\<workflow>.log  
  
### Location  
 The MSI log files are located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\<Name\>.log.  
  
 At the end of the file is a summary of the execution, which includes the success or failure status and properties. To find the error in the MSI file, search for "value 3" and review the text before and after.  
  
## ConfigurationFile.ini file
  
### Overview  
 The configuration file contains the input settings that are provided during installation. It can be used to restart the installation without having to enter the settings manually. However, passwords for the accounts, PID, and some parameters are not saved in the configuration file. The settings can be either added to the file or provided by using the command line or the Setup user interface. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2016 Using a Configuration File](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-2016-using-a-configuration-file.md).  
  
### Location  
 The ConfigurationFile.ini is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.  
  
## SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm file
  
### Overview  
 The system configuration check report contains a short description for each executed rule, and the execution status.
  
### Location  
The SystemConfigurationCheck_Report.htm is located at %programfiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>\\.

# View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

SQL Server Setup creates log files in a dated and time-stamped folder within **\%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log** by default, where *nnn* are numbers that correspond to the version of SQL that's being installed. The time-stamped log folder name format is YYYYMMDD_hhmmss. When Setup is executed in unattended mode, the logs are created within %temp%\sqlsetup*.log. All files in the log folder are archived into the Log\*.cab file in their respective log folder.

 >[!NOTE]
 > パス *nnn* の数字は、インストールされる SQL のバージョンに相当します。 上記の画像では、SQL 2017 がインストールされ、フォルダーは 140 です。 SQL 2016 の場合、フォルダーは 130 になり、SQL 2014 の場合、フォルダーは 120 になります。
  
 SQL Server セットアップでは、3 つの基本的な段階が完了します。 
  
1.  グローバル ルール検証: 基本的なシステム要件を検証します
2.  コンポーネント更新: インストールされているメディアに対して利用できる更新があるかどうかを確認します
3.  ユーザーが要求した操作: ユーザーは機能を選択し、カスタマイズできます
  

このワークフローでは、1 つの概要ログと、SQL Server の基本インストールの 1 つの詳細ログ、または基本インストールと共に更新プログラム (サービス パックなど) がインストールされたときは 2 つの詳細ログが生成されます。 
  
さらに、データストア ファイルには、セットアップ プロセスによって追跡記録されるすべての構成オブジェクトの状態を示すスナップショットが含まれており、構成エラーのトラブルシューティングに便利です。 XML ダンプ ファイルが実行段階ごとに作成され、タイムスタンプ付きのログ フォルダー内の Datastore ログ サブフォルダーに保存されます。
